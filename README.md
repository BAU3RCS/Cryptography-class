# Cryptography-class
Cryptography class used for class and CTF competitions.
I did not write the code in the Cryptools-master folder, the CrackingCodesFiles folder, and several possibly duplicate files in root.
If there is any kind of header in the file with external sources or credit, it is not written by me.
The rest was either modefied by me or written quickly from various sources using code from files in the folders above.
